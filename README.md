# CTP-Hackathon

## Description
Bytes of Creativity is a web-based social media platform geared towards artists. Users can: create an account and log in/out, post pictures with a title and description, view and edit their profile, and follow other users. What makes Appname unique compared to other social media platforms is that it includes an AI-generated weekly challenge prompt for artists to participate in, where the top three winners are determined by the amount of likes, along with the ability to report AI-generated images.

## Tech Stack
For frontend development, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. For backend development, we used Firebase and JavaScript.

For project management, we used Jira to create and assign tickets. We also worked on our tickets in separate branches, created pull requests, and required at least one more team member to review before merging into main.
